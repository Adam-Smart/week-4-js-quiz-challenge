# week-4-js-quiz-challenge

## Description
The webpage I have created is a quiz about Javascript. For the quiz I have included questions that once answered will progress to the next question and will do so until the user reaches the end of all the questions. Once all the questions have been answered they are presented with a screen where they can save their scores with their initials into the local storage. They are also shown a "Try Again" button which allows them to have another go at answering the questions on the quiz.

This quiz has an included timer of 75 seconds which counts down as the user goes through the quiz and if a question is answered incorrectly the time they have remaining is reduced by 10 seconds. Once the timer counts down to 0 the quiz will end and the score will be displayed. If they answer the question correctly they are given a point towards the score and an additional 5 seconds to the timer.
